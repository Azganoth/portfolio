  "bio_description_1": "I'm Ademir, a full-stack developer with a degree in Computer Science, focused on transforming ideas into robust, scalable, and accessible digital solutions. My experience covers the full product lifecycle, from architecture to deployment, with proficiency in technologies like React, Next.js, Svelte, Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. I always seek the right tool for each challenge, ensuring high-performance and quality deliveries.",
  "bio_description_2": "I am driven by solving problems efficiently and with a focus on quality. On the {nexus} project, a full-stack link aggregation platform, I developed the application from the ground up, from database architecture to production deployment. I built a RESTful API with Node.js and Express, implemented a secure authentication system with JWTs, and automated the entire development and deployment pipeline using Docker and GitHub Actions.",
  "bio_description_3": "I'm not content with just using tools and libraries; I seek to understand how they work 'under the hood.' On the frontend, this curiosity led me to create {simplemotionreact}, a zero-dependency animation library for React. In it, I developed a robust state machine using hooks to orchestrate the transition phases of components throughout their lifecycle. I am always looking to improve and collaborate on creating high-quality solutions.",
