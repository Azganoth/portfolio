This is a visually impactful landing page for a fictional mobile sound equalizer application. The project was a practical exercise focused on building complex and responsive layouts using pure CSS and code organization methodologies.

### Main Features

- **Fully Responsive Design**: Fluidly adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops, following a mobile-first approach.
- **Complex Graphic Elements**: Features background patterns and positioned images to create a rich and modern visual experience.
- **Semantic Structure**: Built with semantic HTML to ensure maximum accessibility and search engine optimization.

### Tools and Technologies

The project was built with **semantic HTML** and styled with pure **CSS**. To organize the styles in a scalable way, I applied the **BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)** methodology, which resulted in modular and easy-to-maintain code. The design approach was strictly **mobile-first**, ensuring a high-quality experience on mobile devices that expands to larger screens.

### Technical Challenges and Learnings

- **Positioning of Graphic Elements**: The main challenge was positioning the graphic elements (background patterns and images) so that they adjusted correctly on different screen resolutions without breaking the layout. I used CSS properties like `position: absolute` and `transform`, along with `media queries`, to control the exact positioning of the elements at each breakpoint.
- **CSS Organization with BEM**: In a project with many custom elements, it was crucial to prevent the CSS from becoming confusing. Adopting the **BEM** methodology resulted in classes with low coupling and high cohesion, making each component's style independent, easy to understand, and maintainable.
