This is a landing page for a fictional market research service. The project was an opportunity to delve into advanced CSS techniques, focusing on creating a style codebase that was organized, scalable, and easy to maintain.

### Main Features

- **Fully Responsive Design**: The interface adapts fluidly to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops, following a mobile-first approach.
- **Clear and Semantic Structure**: Built with semantic HTML to ensure maximum accessibility and search engine optimization.
- **Modular and Scalable Styling**: The CSS was structured using the BEM methodology, resulting in independent and reusable style components.

### Tools and Technologies

The project was built with **semantic HTML** and styled with the **SASS** pre-processor. To organize the CSS, I adopted the **BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)** methodology, which resulted in a modular, conflict-free, and easy-to-understand style codebase. The design approach was mobile-first, using `media queries` to progressively adapt the layout for larger screens.

### Technical Challenges and Learnings

- **Applying the BEM Methodology**: The main challenge was to rigorously apply the **BEM** naming convention in conjunction with the **SASS** file architecture. By separating styles by components (blocks), the codebase became extremely clean, predictable, and scalable, making it easier to maintain and add new elements without the risk of CSS conflicts.
- **Advanced SASS Usage**: To reduce code repetition, I utilized advanced **SASS** features, such as **mixins** to reuse style blocks (e.g., for buttons and `media queries`) and **nesting** to mirror the HTML structure. This resulted in a leaner (DRY) CSS codebase that is much simpler to maintain.
