This is a modern and responsive landing page for a fictional online course platform. The project was a practical exercise in building a complex and visually rich interface using exclusively the utility-first approach of TailwindCSS.

### Main Features

- **Multi-Grid Layout**: The page features a complex grid layout for the course cards, which adapts fluidly across mobile, tablet, and desktop resolutions.
- **Interactive Hover States**: Buttons and other interactive elements have hover states that improve visual feedback for the user.
- **Fully Responsive Design**: Built with a mobile-first approach, the design ensures an optimized user experience across all screen sizes.

### Tools and Technologies

The project was built with **semantic HTML** to ensure a clear and accessible structure. Styling was implemented entirely with **TailwindCSS**, leveraging its utility-first approach to speed up development, reduce the need for custom CSS, and ensure simplified maintenance.

### Technical Challenges and Learnings

- **Building Complex Layouts with a Utility-First Approach**: The main challenge was creating an asymmetrical and responsive card grid without writing a single line of custom CSS. I used **TailwindCSS's** grid system and responsive utility classes (`md:`, `lg:`) to build the complex layout directly in the HTML. This deepened my knowledge of how to create custom designs quickly and declaratively, strengthening my skills with CSS frameworks.
- **Ensuring Consistency in Responsive Design**: Maintaining visual and spacing consistency across 3 different breakpoints was crucial. I adopted a strict **mobile-first** approach, developing for the smallest screen first and then adding classes to adapt the layout for larger screens. The result was a fluid and consistent interface across all devices.
