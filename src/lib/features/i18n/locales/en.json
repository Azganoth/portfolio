  "bio_description_1": "I'm Ademir, a Software Engineer with a Computer Science degree. My specialty is developing scalable web applications in the JavaScript ecosystem, transforming complex requirements into performant and accessible interfaces. I focus on modern frontend architecture (React, Next.js, TypeScript) and efficient integration with backend services.",
  "bio_description_2": "In product development, I prioritize code quality and solution robustness. At {nexus}, I worked as a Full-Stack engineer designing a Monorepo architecture that unifies Frontend and Backend with total Type-Safety. Besides developing responsive interfaces, I implemented secure RESTful APIs, automated tests, and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring consistent delivery flows aligned with market best practices.",
  "bio_description_3": "My technical approach goes beyond visual implementation; I strive for performance and the best developer experience (DX). This is reflected in projects like {smr}, where I explored React lifecycles to create optimized animations, and {fixmyhalo}, where I used WebAssembly and Rust to solve graphic processing bottlenecks in the browser.",
